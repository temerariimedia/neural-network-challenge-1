# Student Loan Repayment Prediction

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to predict whether a borrower will repay their student loan. The prediction helps in providing personalized interest rates and building a recommendation system for student loans.

## Overview
The project utilizes a dataset of student loan recipients to train a neural network model. The model predicts the likelihood of loan repayment based on financial and demographic factors. Additionally, the project discusses the feasibility of building a recommendation system for student loan options.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Financial data: Income, expenses, credit score, etc.
- Demographic data: Age, employment type, education level.
- Loan repayment history: Credit ranking as the target variable.

Data Source: [Student Loans Dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csv)

## Model Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Splitting data into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
   - Scaling features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Sequential model with:
     - Two hidden layers using the `relu` activation function.
     - Output layer using the `sigmoid` activation function for binary classification.

3. **Training**:
   - Model trained for 50 epochs with validation data.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated using test data.
   - Metrics: Loss and accuracy.

5. **Predictions**:
   - Used the trained model to predict loan repayment success.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of `XX%` on the test dataset.
- **Classification Report**:
  - Precision, recall, and F1-scores for binary classification.

## Challenges and Considerations
1. **Data Privacy and Security**:
   - Handling sensitive borrower data securely.
2. **Bias in Recommendations**:
   - Ensuring fairness and avoiding demographic biases in predictions.

## Future Work
- Implement a recommendation system for student loans using content-based filtering.
- Explore collaborative or context-based filtering methods for loan recommendations.
- Address potential biases in the dataset and enhance fairness.
